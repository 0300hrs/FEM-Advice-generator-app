### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For the first time outside of a learning environment I used the Javascript fetch function to call an API.

### Continued development

I am hoping to work with more complex APIs.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - This helped place the dice button with the overflow (outside the card).
- [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/css.com) - This is an amazing site which helped me remember syntax i had forgotten. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning CSS.
